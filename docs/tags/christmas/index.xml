      <description>The German Hazelnut Macaroons (in German “Haselnussmakronen”) are traditional and classic German cookies for the Holiday season and Christmas. Germany is known for its unique and delicious Christmas Bakery. If you have not made any German Christmas cookies before, then this recipe is very good to begin with. In Germany we use very thin wafers for these cookies.</description>

      <description>German Vanilla Crescents are classic and traditional Christmas cookies. They are very easy to make and you don’t need special ingredients, just Vanilla Sugar. This is my favorite of all German Christmas cookies, and the best were from my aunt. They were soft and sweet; the smell of vanilla was in the air… Making them every year! Happy Baking.</description>

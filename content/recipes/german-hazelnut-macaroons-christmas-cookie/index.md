yield: 20-40
prepTime: 30
cookTime: 10-15

ingredients:
- 4 egg white
- 200 g fine sugar (confectionery sugar)
- 200 g ground hazelnuts or hazelnut flour
- hazelnuts cut in half for decoration
- 1 hint of cinnamon
- 2 tbsp flour for dusting
- 30 wafers, 40 or 50mm (very thin round piece of unleavened bread) – optional

directions:
- Preheat oven to 300 degrees F.
- Beat egg white with pinch of salt very firm by using a hand mixer (so firm that if you cut it with the knife you would see the cut!)
- Add sugar; sieve it over the firm egg white and carefully mix it.
- Then add the hazelnuts and cinnamon and mix it carefully (don’t use the mixer, use  a wooden spoon). If you cannot get ground hazelnuts or hazelnut flour, you can use a coffee grinder to grind them.
- Dust a baking tray with flour or layer it with parchment paper.
- Place on each wafer with 2 teaspoons a small amount of hazelnut batter and place in the middle one half of a hazelnut (or a small whole one).
- Bake them for 10-15 minutes depending on the oven. Check frequently, you don’t want the wafers become brown.

The German Hazelnut Macaroons (in German “Haselnussmakronen”) are traditional and classic German cookies for the Holiday season and Christmas. Germany is known for its unique and delicious Christmas Bakery. If you have not made any German Christmas cookies before, then this recipe is very good to begin with. In Germany we use very thin wafers for these cookies.

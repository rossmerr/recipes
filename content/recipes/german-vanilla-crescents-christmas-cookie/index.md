German Vanilla Crescents are classic and traditional Christmas cookies. They are very easy to make and you don’t need special ingredients, just Vanilla Sugar. This is my favorite of all German Christmas cookies, and the best were from my aunt. They were soft and sweet; the smell of vanilla was in the air… Making them every year! Happy Baking.

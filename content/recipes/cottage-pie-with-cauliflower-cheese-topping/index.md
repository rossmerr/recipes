prepTime: 15
cookTime: 60

ingredients:
- 1 onion, roughly chopped
- 1 large carrot, roughly chopped
- 2 tsp rosemary leaves
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 400g Waitrose Hereford Mince Beef
- 150g red split lentils
- 2 tbsp tomato purée
- 1 Oxo Rich Beef With Onion & Rosemary Stock Pot
- 600ml boiling water
- 500g floury potatoes, such as Maris Piper or King
- Edward, peeled and cut into large chunks
- 1 medium cauliflower, cut into florets
- 100ml crème fraîche
- 100g mature Cheddar cheese, grated

directions:
- Preheat the oven to 200°C, gas mark 6. Place the onion, carrot and rosemary in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan and add the mixture and gently cook for 6 minutes, until softened but not coloured.

- Add the mince beef and mix with the vegetables, cooking for 2 minutes until browned and breaking up with a wooden spoon. Add the red lentils and tomato purée and cook for 1 minute. Mix together the stockpot and water and stir into the pan. Cook gently for 20 minutes without a lid, until the lentils are tender.

- Meanwhile, place the potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil and cook for 10 minutes then add the cauliflower and cook for a further 7 minutes until the potatoes and cauliflower are very soft when pierced with a knife. Drain well and return to the pan with the crème fraîche, cheese and a pinch of salt and mash together until you have a creamy yet coarse mash.

- Spoon the beef and lentil mix into a 35x25cm ovenproof dish then spoon the mash on top leaving it quite rough for a crispy crust. Bake for 25-30 minutes until golden, crusty and bubbling.

Our cottage pie with cauliflower cheese topping is the perfect warming dinner. Tip: try using creamy cannellini beans or even haricot beans as an alternative to make the mash.

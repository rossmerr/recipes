ingredients:

- 1 small cauliflower cut into bite-sized florets
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 tbsp coconut oil
- 1 medium onion finely chopped
- 2 garlic cloves minced
- 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger
- 1 tbsp turmeric
- 1 tsp cumin
- 1 tsp coriander
- 0.5 tsp dried red pepper flakes
- 180 g dried red lentils
- 797 ml 28 oz can diced tomatoes
- 415 ml 14 oz can light coconut milk
- 72.5 g frozen peas
- 2 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro
- Salt and black pepper to taste

directions:
- Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. On the parchment, toss cauliflower florets with olive oil until all lightly coated, and spread in a single layer. Roast for 15 minutes until golden and tender. Set aside.
- In a large, deep skillet, heat coconut oil over medium-high, and add onion, garlic and ginger. Cook, stirring for about 5 minutes until onion is translucent. Add lentils and turmeric, cumin, coriander, and red pepper flakes. Stir to coat, then add tomatoes, and coconut milk.
- Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, 20 - 25 minutes, or until liquid is absorbed and lentils are tender but not mushy.
- Add peas and roasted cauliflower and continue to cook just until heated through. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and garnish with cilantro. Serve with basmati rice and/or naan bread, and Greek yogurt.
